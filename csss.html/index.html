        Here is an html file that you can use to experiment with your styles.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You'll need to add a separate CSS file in this workspace and add the link element at the top of this file so that this HTML file links to the CSS file (as shown in the instructions above).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Once you have linked your style sheet and added a CSS rule, you should see the styles change in the preview on the right!
